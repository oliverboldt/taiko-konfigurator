			text: "<p>We offer Nagado-daikos and Hira-daikos in different sizes. Our Taikos are precisely manufactured in shape \
				and size as specified in Japan and in the unit of measurement Shaku. A shaku is almost exactly 30cm. \
				Thus, 1.4 shaku corresponds to a playable skin diameter of 42 cm (42 Nagado). 1.6 shaku are accordingly \
				48cm (playable) skin diameter (48er Nagado).</p>\
				<p>A <b>48 Nagado-daiko (1,6 shaku)</b> is a very universal drum. You can play them with very thick bachi, which is \
				very interesting for the side punch technique (Japanese &quot;Yoko-uchi&quot; or &quot;Naname-uchi&quot;). \
				Due to its size and weight of approx. 20kg, this drum is of course more complex to transport. The height \
				 of the Nagado-daiko is 60cm.</p> \
				<p>A <b>42 Nagado-daiko (1,4 shaku)</b> has clear advantages here and is in no way inferior to its larger sister in terms \
				of looks and sound. It weighs less than 14kg and fits in every car trunk and also likes to go on the back seat. \
				It also cuts a fine figure on an inclined stand and can still be played powerfully with medium Bachi. The height is 52.5 cm.</p>"

			(playable skin diameter 42 cm) to 51 cm (1.4 to 1.7 shaku). The height of the drum body is about half that of a Miya-daiko. \
			Such a drum is much lighter and can be transported without a car. The sound of a hira-daiko is also flatter and the tone longer \
			than that of a miya. For the Taiko styles Yoko-uchi (Japanese for &quot;hit sideways&quot;) and Naname-uchi (Japanese for \
				&quot;hit at an angle&quot;) you need a Miya-daiko described above.</p>"
