				My idea was born. Step by step and after receiving a great deal of sound advice and patience my own \
				Taiko was built. A Taiko that suits my needs perfectly .</p>\
				<p>I spoke to my 'Taiko pal' Oliver Boldt from Hamburg whose professional expertise,\
				patience and understanding I really appreciate and treasure.\
				Oliver has been building Japanese drums since the late 1990s.\
				At first to meet his personal requirements and that of his own Taiko group.\
				His workshop is perfectly equipped to build Taikos oriented on the original \
				Japanese drums whilst incorporating his practical skills and experience taking the needs \
				and wishes of other drummers into consideration. \
				Since developing the 'Taicut.cnc'-milling machine he is able to offer really high quality \
				Taikos at a fair price.</p>"

				I set up a small workshop and the work became easier and the quality improved.\

				<p>Over the years I have built all of the instruments for my group 'Yo Bachi Daiko.'\
				Shimen, Nagados, O-Daikos and Okedos. External requests also increased. \
				Until the beginning of 2015 my main occupation had been working as a software developer. \
				This was a great help in designing the concept for the Taicut.cnc milling machine. \
				This precision machine brings the rough form of the corpus into perfect shape, giving \
				it our  unique sound. This was the last step to lifting Taikos built in Europe to a higher level.</p>"

				Why should this be? There are a number of reasons that influence the sound.</p>\
				<p>The shape of the body plays a \
				significant role. The round bodied form contributes considerably to the 'round sound'. \
				When the stick (bachi) hits the skin it sends off a sound wave, extending in the direction of the second skin \
				as well as to the internal wall reflecting there and fragmenting. Thus creating an overtone. The result is the \
				sound of the Taiko we hear and recognise.</p>\
				<p>When the body is too upright the sound is 'tinny'. This is easy to hear if the Taiko has been made of cheap material \
				or wine barrels.</p><p> The inside curve is increased (refer to picture) in order to make the most of the positive \
				effect of the curve. This creates a stave that is thinner in the middle getting thicker on the outside.</p>"
