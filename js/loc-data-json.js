				Whenever possible I visit workshops and love the contact and lively exchange with my fellow drummers.</p> \
				<p>Something we all had in common was trying to find high quality and affordable instruments.\
				My idea was born. Step by step and after receiving a great deal of sound advice and patience my own \
				Taiko was built. A Taiko that suits my needs perfectly .</p>\
				<p>I spoke to my 'Taiko pal' Oliver Boldt from Hamburg whose professional expertise,\
				patience and understanding I really appreciate and treasure.\
				Oliver has been building Japanese drums since the late 1990s.\
				At first to meet his personal requirements and that of his own Taiko group.\
				His workshop is perfectly equipped to build Taikos oriented on the original \
				Japanese drums whilst incorporating his practical skills and experience taking the needs \
				and wishes of other drummers into consideration. \
				Since developing the 'Taicut.cnc'-milling machine he is able to offer really high quality \
				Taikos at a fair price.</p>"

			text: "<p>When I began playing Taiko in 1998 there was nothing on the European market to be found.\
				Out Of necessity a small team and I built our first Shime-daikos. Also, I got hold of a few wine \
				barrels, converted and refined them as Nagado-daikos.\
				I set up a small workshop and the work became easier and the quality improved.\
				My qualification as a craftsman came to my advantage.</p>\
				<p>Over the years I have built all of the instruments for my group 'Yo Bachi Daiko.'\
				Shimen, Nagados, O-Daikos and Okedos. External requests also increased. \
				Until the beginning of 2015 my main occupation was working as a software developer. \
				This was a great help in designing the concept for the Taicut.cnc milling machine. \
				This precision machine brings the rough form of the corpus into perfect shape, giving \
				it our  unique sound. This was the last step to lifting Taikos built in Europe to a higher level.</p>"
